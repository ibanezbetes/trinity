# EAS Build ignore file - MINIMAL approach
# Only ignore what's absolutely necessary

# Build artifacts
node_modules/
.expo/
dist/
build/
*.log

# Version control
.git/

# Test files only (not source files)
__tests__/
**/__tests__/
*.test.ts
*.test.tsx
*.spec.ts
*.spec.tsx
jest.config.js

# Native folders (using managed workflow)
/android
/ios

# CRITICAL: Ensure NO source files are ignored
# All .ts/.tsx files in src/ must be included
